       <h1>The <span class="pink">Problem</span></h1><br>
        <p>Many students and staff at UFV want to stay active, meet new people, and feel more connected to the campus community. But staying motivated is hard, and most fitness apps today focus more on profit than on helping the people who use them. They collect data, push ads, and don’t give anything back to students.<br>
UFV doesn’t have a simple tool that brings everyone together for weekly runs, Tracks progress in an easy way, or supports student life through fundraising. Because of this, the community is missing out on a healthy, fun, and positive way to stay active while helping each other.</p>
        </div>
       <div class="col-md-12 row" id="solution">
        <div class="col-md-7">
         <h1>Our <span class="purple">Solution</span></h1><br>
         <p>The best way to fix the problems our UFV community faces is to create something simple, helpful, and made for everyone. Club Hub is designed exactly for that. It combines fitness, social connection, and small fundraising efforts into one easy app.
<br>The idea behind Club Hub is not complicated. People stay active when they feel supported. People join events when they know friends are going. People care more when they see their efforts helping someone else. Club Hub brings all of this together. Instead of sending students to expensive fitness apps or confusing platforms, we built a single space where UFV users can track their Saturday runs, keep up with friends, and support student programs without feeling pressured or overwhelmed.
<br>The app also removes the usual barriers. There are no ads, no “premium upgrades,” and no hidden fees. Everything is built around the idea of helping the UFV community grow stronger. By focusing on motivation, teamwork, and transparent fundraising, Club Hub creates a healthier campus and a better student experience. It gives people a reason to stay active, a place to belong, and a way to make a difference at the same time.</p></div>

        </div>
        <h1>Why <span class="purple">IT Matter</span></h1><br>
         <p>A healthier and more connected campus doesn’t happen on its own. Students today deal with stress, isolation, and busy schedules. Many want to exercise or make new friends, but they don’t know where to start. Small things—like weekly runs, shared progress, friendly challenges, and group motivation—can make a huge difference.
<br>When people move together, they feel better. When they feel better, they do better in school, work, and life. Club Hub makes it easy for UFV members to take that first step. It doesn’t judge, it doesn’t pressure, and it doesn’t promote unrealistic goals. It simply gives people something positive to be part of.
<br>This matters because the benefits go beyond fitness. The app helps build friendships, reduce stress, and create a community that supports each other. At the same time, the fundraising side helps real UFV students who need assistance. A single run can contribute to someone’s textbook fund, meal plan, or emergency support. That creates a cycle where the community helps itself grow stronger.</p></div>

<h1>APP <span class="purple">Features</span></h1><br>
         <p>AClub Hub is built around three main sections — <b>Fitness</b>, <b>Social</b>, and <b>Fundraising</b> — but each section includes several helpful tools that make the app useful every day.<br><br>
<b>1. Fitness Tracking</b><br>
The fitness part of the app helps users stay active without making things complicated. It tracks the Saturday runs, but it also works for regular daily exercise. Users can check their distance, pace, calories, and weekly progress. The app saves all past runs, so people can see how much they’ve improved over time. It also connects with phones and smartwatches, making tracking automatic for those who prefer it.<br><br>
<b>2. Progress Dashboard</b><br>
The progress dashboard gives users a clear picture of their habits. It shows weekly summaries, monthly totals, and milestone achievements. Badges and small rewards give people something fun to work toward. The dashboard is simple and easy to read, so users don’t need to be fitness experts to understand their progress.<br><br>
<b>3. Saturday Run Hub</b><br>
Since the project is built around UFV’s Satirday community run, the app includes a special section just for that. Users can check the schedule, see who else is joining, and get reminders before the run starts. After the run, they can view group stats and see how the entire UFV community performed that week.<br><br>
<b>4. Social Challenges</b><br>
The social section focuses on connection. Users can add friends, join running groups, and send friendly challenges like “Run 3 km this week” or “Beat my Saturday time.” These small challenges help people stay motivated and make the experience more fun. This also creates a feeling of teamwork instead of competition.<br><br>
<b>5. Community Feed</b><br>
The app includes a simple feed where people can share achievements, post updates, or celebrate progress. It’s not meant to be a full social media platform—just a positive space where UFV members can support each other. Users can like and comment on posts, which helps build a sense of belonging.<br><br>
<b>6. Fundraising Hub</b><br>
The fundraising part of the app supports UFV students directly. Users can sponsor themselves per kilometre or choose a small amount to donate each week. Groups can also work together to reach community goals. All money earned stays on campus and goes toward student support, small bursaries, or wellness programs.<br><br>
<b>7. Transparent Donations</b><br>
To build trust, the app shows exactly where the money goes. Users can see how much has been raised and which student programs or events are benefiting from it. This makes fundraising open and honest, which helps the community feel more comfortable participating.<br><br>
<b>8. Event Calendar</b><br>
Club Hub includes an events page that lists UFV activities related to fitness, wellness, and community life. Users can join events, get reminders, and see which friends are attending. This helps bring more people out to campus activities and builds school spirit.<br><br>
<b>9. Profile Customization</b><br>
Each user gets a simple profile where they can add a picture, set fitness goals, and list their interests. This makes it easier to connect with others and find people who enjoy similar activities.<br><br>
<b>10. No Ads, No Premium Versions</b><br>
Unlike most fitness apps, Club Hub has no ads and no paid upgrades. Everything is included for all users. This keeps the app simple, fair, and focused on helping the UFV community rather than making profit.<br><br>



        <h1>How <span class="purple">It Helps UFV</span></h1><br>
         <p>Club Hub supports UFV in several meaningful ways. It encourages healthy habits by giving students and staff an easy way to stay active. When people feel better physically, it often improves their mental health, class performance, and overall well-being. The app makes it simple for users to join weekly runs, stay motivated, and build routines that fit into busy schedules.<br><br>
<b>1. Stronger Campus Community</b><br>
The app brings people together. Students, staff, and alumni can connect through Saturday runs, group challenges, and shared fitness goals. This helps build friendships across different programs and creates a more supportive campus culture. Instead of everyone exercising alone, Club Hub turns fitness into a shared UFV activity.<br><br>
<b>2. Better Student Engagement</b><br>
Club Hub gives students a reason to participate in campus life. Events, reminders, and group runs keep people involved, which increases engagement and strengthens UFV’s overall student experience. It also makes it easier for new students to meet others and feel at home.<br><br>
<b>3. Support for Student Programs</b><br>
The fundraising hub provides a new way for UFV to support students. Money collected through the app stays on campus and goes toward bursaries, wellness programs, and small student projects. This creates real value for students who need financial help or campus support.<br><br>
<b>4. Positive Image for the University</b><br>
A modern, community-focused app shows that UFV cares about student health, connection, and well-being. It strengthens UFV’s reputation as a university that supports its people instead of relying on commercial fitness apps that profit from users. When the community sees UFV investing in its own students, it builds trust and pride in the school.<br><br>
Club Hub helps UFV become healthier, more connected, and more supportive. It gives people a reason to participate, stay active, and contribute to a stronger campus environment.<br><br>

        <h1>Ethical <span class="purple">Theories</span></h1>
        <h3> (How Club Hub Follows Them)<span class="purple"></span></h3>
  <br>
<b>1. Subjective Relativism</b><br>
Each person decides what is right for themselves. The app supports this because users choose their own goals, pace, and level of involvement. No pressure — everyone participates in the way that works best for them.<br><br>
<b>2. Cultural Relativism</b><br>
Every community defines its own values. UFV values health, connection, and student support. The app fits these values by promoting fitness, teamwork, and fundraising that stays inside UFV.<br><br>
<b>3. Divine Command</b><br>
Some people follow moral beliefs based on religion or faith. The app supports positive action like helping others, building community, and encouraging care, which aligns with most moral and faith-based teachings.<br><br>
<b>4. Ethical Egoism</b><br>
People naturally act in their own self-interest. When users join runs to improve their own health, they also help UFV raise funds and build community. Everyone benefits while looking after themselves.<br><br>
<b>5. Kantianism</b><br>
We should do what is right and never use people for profit. The app has no ads, no paid upgrades, and no data selling. It puts people first and treats every user with respect.<br><br>
<b>6. Act Utilitarianism</b><br>
A single action is right if it produces happiness. Each run, each challenge, each donation helps someone at UFV. Small actions from users create real benefits for the community.<br><br>
<b>7. Rule Utilitarianism</b><br>
Following rules that create long-term happiness is best. The app encourages habits like weekly runs, community support, and fair fundraising — all rules that bring ongoing benefits to UFV.<br><br>
<b>8. Social Contract</b><br>
Society works when people agree to fair rules. The app creates a supportive space where UFV members follow simple guidelines, respect each other, and work together to build a healthier campus.<br><br>
<b>8a. Rawl’s Theory of Justice</b><br>
Fairness matters. Everyone gets equal access to all features with no any premiumm versions, no paywalls. Fundraising money is used fairly to support students who need help.<br><br>
<b>9. Virtue Ethics</b><br>
Focuses on good character. The app encourages discipline, teamwork, honesty, and care for others through community runs, shared goals, and positive support.<br><br>
<b>9.5 Ethics of Care</b><br>
Relationships and support are central. The app helps people look out for each other, celebrate small wins, and raise money for students who need it. It builds a caring UFV community.<br><br>


        <h1>Privacy <span class="purple" id="privacy">& Data Protection</span></h1>
<br>
Privacy is one of the biggest concerns people have when using fitness or social apps. Many companies collect personal information, track location, and sell data without clearly telling users. Club Hub is built to avoid all of these problems. The app protects users by collecting only the information needed for basic fitness tracking and community features, and nothing more.<br><br>
We make it clear what data is used and why. Distance, pace, and step data are only collected so users can track their runs. Profile details, such as names or photos, are optional. Users decide what they want to share, and every setting can be changed at any time. Nothing is hidden, and nothing is used for profit.<br><br>
<b>1. No Data Selling</b><br>
Many fitness apps make money by selling user data to advertisers. Club Hub never does this. All information stays inside UFV’s system and is only used to support the app’s features. User data is not shared with outside companies for any reason.<br><br>
<b>2. Clear Permissions</b><br>
If the app asks for access to something like GPS or step counting, it will always explain why. Users can say yes or no. The app continues to work even if some permissions are denied, because we don’t want people to feel forced into giving up privacy.<br><br>
<b>3. Simple Data Storage</b><br>
The data saved in the app is kept secure and used only to show users their progress. It is not used for advertising, tracking users around campus, or analyzing personal habits. We avoid collecting sensitive information such as location history, contacts, or personal health data beyond the basics.<br><br>
<b>4. User Control</b><br>
Users can delete their account and all of their data at any time. Nothing is stored after deletion. This gives people full control over their information and keeps the app honest and transparent.<br><br>
By respecting privacy from the start, Club Hub builds trust with the UFV community. The app focuses on helping people—not using them for profit or hidden data collection. This makes Club Hub a safer and more ethical choice than typical fitness or social apps.<br><br>

        <h1>Community <span class="purple">Impact</span></h1>
<br>
Club Hub brings more than fitness tracking and social features. It has a real positive impact on the UFV community. It creates a healthier environment, encourages involvement, and supports students through fundraising. Even small steps, like completing a Saturday run or joining a group challenge, have long-term benefits for the campus.<br><br>
<b>1. Healthier Students and Staff</b><br>
Regular exercise reduces stress, improves focus, and boosts overall well-being. When more people take part in Saturday runs and fitness challenges, the entire campus becomes healthier. This helps students succeed in classes and reduces burnout during busy semesters.<br><br>
<b>2. Stronger Campus Connections</b><br>
Club Hub makes it easy to meet people who share similar goals. This builds friendships across programs and departments. The sense of community improves campus life and makes UFV feel more welcoming to new students.<br><br>
<b>3. Real Support for Students</b><br>
Money raised through the app stays inside UFV. It can help fund student projects, emergency support, wellness events, or small bursaries. Each run has a purpose, and every user plays a role in improving student life. This gives the community a reason to stay involved and motivated.<br><br>
<b>4. Showcasing UFV Leadership</b><br>
Because no other university has a community-focused fitness and fundraising app like this, UFV has the chance to lead by example. The app shows innovation, student care, and strong ethical values. This can improve UFV’s reputation both locally and outside the Fraser Valley.<br><br>
Club Hub does more than track kilometres. It builds a stronger, healthier, and more connected UFV, creating long-term value for students, staff, and alumni.<br><br>

        <h1>Future <span class="purple">Development</span></h1>
<br>
Club Hub is designed to grow with UFV’s needs. As more people start using the app, new features can be added to make it even more helpful. One future idea is adding group chat options so running clubs can talk easily. Another possible feature is a “Wellness Mode” that includes mental health tips, study reminders, and simple daily goals to support students beyond fitness.<br><br>
The app could also introduce a volunteer system where users earn points for helping at UFV events. These points could be exchanged for small rewards or used to unlock community badges. Another long-term idea is connecting Club Hub with other universities to host inter-campus challenges or wellness competitions.<br><br>
As technology grows, the app could include more smartwatch integrations, better GPS accuracy, and more detailed fitness analytics. But even with new features, the main goal stays the same: support the UFV community in a simple, ethical, and positive way.<br><br>

        <h1> <span class="purple" id="conclusion">Conclusion</span></h1>
<br>
Club Hub brings together fitness, connection, and community support in one easy platform. It solves real problems that UFV students and staff face, such as low motivation, limited campus engagement, and lack of simple fundraising tools. The app stays ethical by protecting user privacy, avoiding ads, and keeping all profits within UFV.<br><br>
By focusing on welness and teamwork, Club Hub helps people feel better, meet others, and support students who need help. It strengthens the UFV community and creates a healthier campus culture. With room for future growth and new features, the app is a strong step toward a more connected and supportive UFV.<br><br>
